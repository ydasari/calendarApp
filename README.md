# calendarApp
This is simple appointment calendar system

Steps for running the application:
1. Clone the repository.
2. run bower install from root directory to install all the dependencies.
3. open index.html in any of the browser.

Please note: I didn't get enough time to complete the assessment. I was just able to display calendar with events. I couldn't add any other functionalities such as adding event, editing or deleting them, but I have created a modal for adding events.
